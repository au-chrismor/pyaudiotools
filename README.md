# pyaudiotools
A handy collection of tools in python for audio processing.  Mostly related to Amateur Radio, but they could be useful elsewhere too.

**display.py**

Accepts a file name from the command line, and displays a graphical representation of the audio.

**filter.py**

Accepts source and destination files as well as filter cutoffs and applies a butterworth filter to the stream.

**spectrum.py**

Accepts a file name (and optionally frequency range) from the command line and displays an FFT spectrum display.
